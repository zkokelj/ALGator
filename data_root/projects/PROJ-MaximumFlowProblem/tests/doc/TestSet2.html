    <p>Test set containing graphs with number of nodes from 500 to 10 000 where each node has indegree and outdegree at least 1, except source node has 
    indegree 0 and sink node has outdegree 0. </p>
    
    <p>For each node (when it reaches indegree 1) the probability that another ingoing edge is created is 50%. 
    If another ingoing edge is created, the next ingoing edge is created with the same probabilty. The same holds for outgoing edges. 
    For the source node only outgoing edges are created and for the sink node only ingoing edges are created. 
    When current node is source node, the probabilty for every other outgoing edge is 90% and the same for ingoing edges for sink. </p>
    
    <p>When selecting to and from which node the current node is connected, source and sink node have 10% more chances to be chosen, 
    then the rest of the nodes. (To ensure high number of paths from source and to sink node.)</p>
    
    <p>Capacity value for each edge is chosen from integer values from 1 to number of nodes in a graph.<p/>
    
    <p>For each size testset contains 5 different test cases.</p>
