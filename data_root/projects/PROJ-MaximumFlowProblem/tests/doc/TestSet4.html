    <p>Test set containing graphs with number of nodes from 500 to 10 000 where each tenth node has indegree and outdegree at least 1, 
    except source node has indegree 0 and sink node has outdegree 0, and every other node has indegree and outdegree 0. </p>
    
    <p>Generator of edges iterates through every tenth node. For each tenth node (when it reaches indegree 1) the probability that another ingoing edge is created is 0%. 
    The same holds for outgoing edges. 
    For the source node only outgoing edges are created and for the sink node only ingoing edges are created. 
    In this testset nodes that are connected to the network are source node, sink node and every tenth node in between.</p>
    
    <p>When selecting to and from which node the current node is connected, source and sink node have 10% more chances to be chosen, 
    then the rest of the nodes. (To ensure high number of paths from source and to sink node.) 
    In this testset, when selecting to and from which node the current node is connected, nodes are chosen from
    source node, sink node and every tenth node in between.</p>
    
    <p>Capacity value for each edge is chosen from integer values from 1 to 30.<p/>
    
    <p>For each size testset contains 5 different test cases.</p>
    
    <p>This testset differentiates from TestSet2 due to smaller number of nodes that are connected to the network 
    (which results to smaller number of edges and larger number of nodes in the whole network). Testset is made to show 
    that EdmonsKarp algorithm (time complexity O(V*E^2)) can run faster (or at the aprox the same speed) as Dinics algorthm 
    (time complexity O(EV^2)) if the number of nodes in the network are higher than number of edges.</p>
