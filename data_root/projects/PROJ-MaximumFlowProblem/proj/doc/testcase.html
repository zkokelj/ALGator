    <p>A test set used in maximum flow problem is a weighted directed graph/network, 
    where weights need to be integer values. Network has to have at least one node that has no ingoing edges edges (called source) 
    and at least one node that has no outgoing edges (called sink).</p>
    
    For the Java programs the test case is declared with<br>

    <center>
    <code> int n;</code> <br>
    <code> int[][] g = new int[n][n];</code> <br>
    <code> int s;</code> <br>
    <code> int t;</code> <br>
    </center>

    where <code>n</code> is the number of nodes in the graph, <code>s</code> is the source node 
    and <code>t</code> is the sink node.
