    <p>To test algorithms for finding maximum flow of a network we used several test sets. TestSet0 
    contains smaller networks, TestSet1 contains medium sized networks and the rest test sets cantain large networks.</p>
    
    
    <p>Larger network sets vary in number of nodes, number of edges and capacity values on edges.
    All networks (except networks from TestSet0, which were found on the web) were created randomy with
    in advance defined number of nodes and different random generators for number of edges and capacity values.</p>
    
    <p>TestSet0 was used to test correctness of the algorithms. 
    All the other test sets were created to test the speed of the algorithms. </p>
