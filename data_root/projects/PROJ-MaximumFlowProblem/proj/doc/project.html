        <p><b>Maximum flow problem</b> involves a direcred graph (N = nodes, E = edges). Edges represents upper bound of flow between two nodes.
        In the graph source and sink nodes are specified. The problem is to find the maximum flow that can be sent through graph from source to sink node.

                          The solution is the assigment of flows to edges. Conservarion of flows is required at each node (except source and sink nodes).
                          From the solution graph we can calculate maxumum flow from source to sink and verify consercation of flows.
