        <p> Maximum flow problem involve finding maximum feasible flow through network/graph with single source and single sink. 
                <br> Vertices are connected with edges. Each edge has a capacity. Main goal is to figure out maximum possible flow. 
               We have to take into account limitations of edge capacities and that in each vertex input and output flows should be equal. <br></p>
