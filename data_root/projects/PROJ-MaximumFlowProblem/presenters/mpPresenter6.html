    This presenter presents all three algorithms minimum running times in respect to number of edges. (On TestSet3). 
From this graph we can see the difference between algorithms when it comes to number of edges in the graph. Dinic is the most effective O(EV^2), FordFulkerson is slightly worse probably because of fight flows O(flow*E). Both are linear in respect to number of edges. The worst algorithm of these three for graphs with many edges is EdmonsKarp with time complexity O(EV^2).
