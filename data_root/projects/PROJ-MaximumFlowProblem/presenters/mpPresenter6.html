    This presenter presents all three algorithms minimum running times in respect to number of edges on TestSet3. 
    From this graph we can see the difference between algorithms when it comes to number of edges in the graph. 
    Dinic (O(EV^2)) is the most effective, FordFulkerson (O(flow*E)) is slightly worse probably because of high numbers 
    of maximum flows in the networks. Both are linear in respect to number of edges. 
    The worst algorithm of these three is EdmonsKarp (O(VE^2)), because
    this test set contains graphs with many edges, which slows the algorithm down.
