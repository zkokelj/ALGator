    This presenter presents Dinics algorithm vs EdmonsKarp algorithm on TestSet4.
<br> TestSet4 test cases have same number of nodes, but significantly less edges.
Sicer time complexities are:
<br>Edmonds time  complexity O(VE^2)
<br>Dinics time ma O(EV^2)
<br> Compared to previous graph we can see that EdmonsKarp algorithm does well with graphs that have small(er) number of edges.
