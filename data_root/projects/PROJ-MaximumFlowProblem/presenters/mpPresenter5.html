    This presenter presents Dinics and EdmonsKarp algorithm on TestSet4.
    <br> TestSet4 test cases have the same number of nodes, but significantly less edges then test cases in TestSet2.
    Time complexities for this two algorithms are:
    <br>Edmonds: O(VE^2)
    <br>Dinics: O(EV^2)
    <br>Compared to previous graph we can see that EdmonsKarp algorithm does well with graphs that have small(er) number of edges.
