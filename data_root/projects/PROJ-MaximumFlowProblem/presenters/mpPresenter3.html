    This presenter presents execution times of all three algorithms on TestSet2. 
    Time complexities for algortihms are:
    <br>Edmonds Karp: O(VE^2)
    <br>Dinics: O(EV^2)
    <br>Ford Fulkerson: O(flow*E)
    <br> Since TestSet2 contains networks with high flow values (which slows down FordFulkerson algorithm) 
    and high number of edges (which slows down Edmonds Karp algorithm) Dinic's algorithm is the fastest on all test cases in this set.
