    <p>Edmonds-Karp algorithm is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method that uses BFS for 
    finding augmenting paths. The algorithm was first published by Yefim Dinitz in 1970, 
    and later independently published by Jack Edmonds and Richard Karp in 1972. </p>
    
    <p> The intuition is, that every time we find an augmenting path, one of the edges becomes saturated 
    and the distance from the edge to source node will be longer, if it appears later again in 
    an augmenting path. The length of a simple paths is bounded by V. 
    Another property of this algorithm is that the length of the shortest augmenting path increases monotonically.</p>
    
    <p>Time Complexity: O(VE^2), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. </p>
