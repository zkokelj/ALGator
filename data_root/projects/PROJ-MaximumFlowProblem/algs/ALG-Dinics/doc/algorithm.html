    <p>Dinicâ€™s algorithm is a way of implementing the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. 
    The running time is O(V^2E) which improves the O(VE^2) of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
    The basic idea is to compute all the augmenting paths that have a certain number of edges at
    once, in what is called a blocking flow computation. Each iteration of this process increases
    the length of the shortest path from source to sink by at least 1. So the number of iterations is at
    most n.</p>
    
    <p>In each phase the algorithms builds a layered graph with breadth-first search on the residual graph. 
    The maximum flow in a layered graph can be calculated in O(VE) time.</p>
