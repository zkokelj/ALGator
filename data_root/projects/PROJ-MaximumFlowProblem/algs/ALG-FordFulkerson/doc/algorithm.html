    <p> The idea behind the algorithm is as follows: as long as there is a path from the source (start node) 
    to the sink (end node), with available capacity on all edges in the path, we send flow along one of the paths. 
    Then we find another path, and so on. A path with available capacity is called an augmenting path.</p>
    
    <p>Time Complexity: O(f*E), where f is the maximum flow and E is the number of edges. 
    This is because each augmenting path can be found in O(E) time and increases the flow by an integer amount which is at least 1. </p>
